# fishingMaps
Make maps of fishing effort (kw hours) and swept area ratio for the North Sea and Celtic Seas. 

## To run
The enclosed R script is designed to run on XYZ data. To facilitate development, several datasets are included (t05, tf05, and tf10). NOTE: these data are randomly generated and have no reflection on actual fishing patterns.
